# Kingdoms and Warfare Actors

Fan implementation of Organizations and Warfare Units for MCDM's [Kingdoms & Warfare](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/kingdoms-warfare) as v11 subtypes for FVTT's dnd5e system.

## Using this module

This module provides character sheets for Organizations and Warfare Units. Both are new actor types that can be created in the sidebar.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION: The DND5E system does not currently support derived statistics for non-native actor types; as such, all values on the sheet are manually calculated and the sheets do not support items or active effects.

### Organizations

Organizations keep a list of affiliated characters in their central "Powers" section; simply drag and drop a character or NPC onto the sheet to add them. Right-clicking an actor listed this way pulls up a context menu with further options.

You can roll organization tests straight from the sheet - simply click on the skill's label. The sheet may then ask you which of its members to use to perform the test, based on which members you have control over.

### Warfare Units

Warfare units keep track of a single associated actor - their commander. Simply drag and drop a character or npc onto the warfare unit's sheet to set the commander. You can also right click the commander to clear the current one or view their sheet.

## Notes on Rights

This does NOT include the actual organizations and warfare units from the book, nor does it copy any trade dress. This is purely a mechanical recreation of the generic sheets provided in the appendix. Permission to distribute this model was provided in a support email with Managing Director Geoff.
